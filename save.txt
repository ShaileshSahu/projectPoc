SEPA Direct Debit is a direct debit payment method that operates in the eurozone. After selecting goods or services, customers reach the merchant’s checkout. When selecting SEPA Direct Debit, customers enter their IBAN/BIC information, after which the amount will be automatically debited from the user’s bank account. Once the payment has been submitted, the merchant receives a URL notification and the purchase can be delivered.
